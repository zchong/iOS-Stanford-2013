#Stanford iOS Programming Course 2013
These are the assignments I did for Stanford's iOS 2013 Winter Course. I am attempting to complete the entire course in a week. 

My background for this course: I had some exposure to Objective-C prior to starting this course. I completed the exercises on various sites like [CodeSchool.com](http://tryobjectivec.codeschool.com). This helped tremendously in keeping up with the course I think.

I already have an intermediate foundation in C/C++ and Java, and while these languages are not required, I'd highly **recommend** at least reading up and becoming familiar with the C-family programming languages.

I read a little into BigNerdRanch's great introduction book to iOS programming, which you can buy from any bookstore, or Amazon if you're like me. I think the book is great for introduction to iOS, but I needed a different way of learning iOS because I wanted to understand more of what I'm doing, instead of simply going through the motion.
